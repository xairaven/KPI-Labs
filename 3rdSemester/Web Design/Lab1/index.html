		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee</b> <ins>(born 8 June 1955)</ins>, also known as TimBL, 
			is an <strong>English computer scientist</strong> best known as the inventor of the 
			<i>World Wide Web</i>. He is a <del>Professorial Fellow of Computer Science</del> 
			at the <em>University of Oxford</em> and a professor at the <mark>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</mark>. 
			Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on <small>12 March 1989</small>, then implemented the first successful 
			communication between a <abbr title="HTTP">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</abbr> client and server via the Internet in mid-November. 
			Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. 
			He co-founded (with his wife-to-be Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. He is a senior researcher and holder of the 
			3Com founder's chair at the <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> 
			Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory <sub>(CSAIL)</sub>. He is a director of the Web Science Research 
			Initiative <sup>(WSRI)</sup> and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. 
			In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the 
			Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe. In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II 
			for his pioneering work. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and helped foster the Web's subsequent 
			explosive development. He currently directs the W3 Consortium, developing tools and standards to further the Web's potential. 
			In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He was named in Time magazine's list of 
			the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of <bdo dir="rtl">other</bdo> accolades for his 
			invention. He was honoured as the <q>"Inventor of the World Wide Web"</q> during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in 
			which he appeared working with a vintage <cite>NeXT Computer</cite>. He tweeted 
			<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/">
				"This is for everyone" which appeared in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the audience. 
				He received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, 
				and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".
